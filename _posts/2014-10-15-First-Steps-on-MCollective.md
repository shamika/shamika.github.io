The Marionette Collective (<a href="https://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/">MCollective</a>) is a compressive toolkit developed by Puppet Labs to programmatically manage/orchestrate the jobs in a clusters of servers. Let me brief some of the use cases which imply the need of such system. Letâ€™s imagine we do have two clusters with 3 nodes each up and running. 

<ul>
<li>
Install a package - Lets say we want to install new package to all the nodes. This may be either a general package (eg:- zip), or the typical use cases of this in a clustered environment will be apply OS patches.
</li>

<li>
Update a configuration - We may find situations where need to update a configuration in all the nodes( eg:- update a conf file )
</li>

<li>
Restart a service - Due to the update of a configuration or any other reason we may need to restart a particular service in all or selected nodes in a cluster
</li>

<li>Debug - Verify the connectivity between/outside the nodes etc.</li>

<li>Monitor - constantly check the status of the all or selected nodes such as load, memory etc.</li>
</ul>
